MathArt

This is a fun project aiming at learning a bit about python aswell as plotting functions for their aestethics and creating mathematical art in the future.

It utilizes the Community Manim Package (Originally by 3Blue1Brown).

To run the animations set up your local python env using:

    uv init --python 3.13

This is the latest compatible Python version. 
Then install the necessary manim package via:

    uv add manim

To try out the existing animations with the interactive openGL renderer use the following command in your terminal:

    manim -p FILE.py SCENE --renderer=opengl

-p signifies that the animation is set to start immediatley.
